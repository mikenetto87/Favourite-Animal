<h1>Dogs - Man's Best Friend</h1>
<p1>Before the 19th century, breeds of dogs (other than lap dogs) were largely functional. They performed activities such as hunting, watching, and guarding; and language describing the dog often reflected these roles. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, “In the oldest proverbs and phrases dogs are rarely depicted as faithful or as man’s best friend, but as vicious, ravening, or watchful.” Beginning in the 18th century, multiplying in the 19th and flourishing in the 20th century, language and attitudes towards dogs began to shift.</p1>

<br>

<p2>The statement that Dog is man's best friend was first recorded as being made by Frederick, King of Prussia (1740-1786). Frederick referred to one of his Italian Greyhounds as his best friend.</p2>

<br>

<p3>In 1870 Warrensburg, Missouri, George Graham Vest represented a farmer suing for damages after his dog, Old Drum, had been shot and killed. Vest’s closing speech included this quote, “The one absolutely unselfish friend that a man can have in this selfish world, the one that never deserts him and the one that never proves ungrateful or treacherous is his dog.” In 1958, a statue of Old Drum was erected on the Johnson County Courthouse lawn containing a summation of Vest’s closing speech, “A man’s best friend is his dog.”</p3>
